          <p class="description">The face is an important aspect in predicting human emotions and mood. Usually the human emotions are extracted with the use of camera. There are many applications getting developed based on detection of human emotions. Few applications of emotion detection are business notification recommendation, e-learning, mental disorder and depression detection, criminal behaviour detection etc. In this proposed system, we develop a prototype in recommendation of dynamic music recommendation system based on human emotions. Based on each human listening pattern, the songs for each emotions are trained. Integration of feature extraction and machine learning techniques, from the real face the emotion are detected and once the mood is derived from the input image, respective songs for the specific mood would be played to hold the users. In this approach, the application gets connected with human feelings thus giving a personal touch to the users. Therefore our projected system concentrate on identifying the human feelings for developing emotion based music player using computer vision and machine learning techniques. For experimental results, we use open CV for emotion detection and music recommendation</p>

          <p class=" description">
            Table tennis (also known as ping-pong or whiff-whaff) is a racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing surface being atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which players stand. Either individually or in teams of two, players take alternating turns returning a light, hollow ball over the table's net onto the opposing half of the court using small rackets until they fail to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. Play is fast, requiring quick reaction and constant attention, and is characterized by an emphasis on spin relative to other ball sports, which can heavily affect the ball's trajectory.

          <p class="description">
            Throwball is popular in Asia, especially on the Indian subcontinent, and was first played in India as a women's sport in Chennai during the 1940s. Like volleyball, the game's roots are linked with the YMCA. Both volleyball and Newcomb ball, while older games, share many similarities with throwball. Throwball rules were first drafted in 1955 and India's first national level championship was played in 1980.
